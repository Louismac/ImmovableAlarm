# ImmovableAlarm

An iPhone project for those who struggle to wake. 

The idea is to purchase a cheap iPhone (or use an old one), I managed to get hold of a 4s for Â£30. 

Load on the app, set the time and then attach to a surface away from the bed as so the phone cannot be moved. I have used adhesive picture mounting strips (http://www.viking-direct.co.uk/catalog/catalogSku.do?id=17023P&configurableItemType=UNDEFINED&pr=Q28). 

When the alarm goes off (playing an mp3 of your choosing), you have to get up and keep your finger on the off button for 2 minutes otherwise the alarm begins again and the countdown resets. Hopefully, by the end of the two minutes your morning fog has lifted and you will not fall back into the returning to bed trap.

Enjoy!
